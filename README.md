# AI_trained_diffusion_model
Code for a diffusion model that learns from a dataset of AI-generated images.

Included in this repository is a Python script for a UNet (credit goes to MaximeVandegar for creating this--I only changed the channel structure to allow for RGB images rather than greyscale) a jupyter notebook compatible for Google Colab that trains the model, and results after training for 200,000 steps.

Here is the link to the data used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/superpotato9/dalle-recognition-dataset

The purpose of this project is to explore which features emerge from a diffusion model that is trained on AI-generated images.
